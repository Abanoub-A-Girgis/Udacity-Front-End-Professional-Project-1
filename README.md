# Landing Page Project

This Github Repo is made to contain the project files for the landing page project for Udacity's Front End Web Development Professional Track

___

The starter code was kindly provided by udacity [here](https://github.com/udacity/fend/tree/refresh-2019/).

The project was to build a multi-section landing page with dynamically updating navigation menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page

The Project uses CSS, Javascript and HTML to achieve the effect.
